            	The TRX signalling load towards the BSC is too high compared with the signalling bandwidth.
A possible reason is that the signalling load is high and the signalling bandwidth is reduced by using LAPD concentration or LAPD multiplexing.</b8>

Only a warning, but if the signal load increases, AO CON EC1:8 LAPD Q CG (LAPD queue congestion) might be raised and traffic lost.</b8>
